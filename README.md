# All-ML-Algorithm

This code showcases how to implement and evaluate nearly all Ml models. Key takeaways include the importance of data preprocessing (scaling!) and leveraging metrics like confusion matrices and ROC curves for robust model evaluation.
It is a great opportunity to reinforce your skills in Python, NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn in a practical application. Check out the project for a deeper dive into classification techniques and model performance analysis!

- What the Code Can Do
â€¢ Building and training classification models: Specifically for binary classification tasks (e.g., predicting the presence or absence of a condition).

â€¢ Applying essential data preprocessing techniques: Such as data splitting and feature scaling.

â€¢ Implementation and execution of almost all ML supervised and unsepervised models e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forrest, SVM, ADABOOST, XGBOOST, ANN, K-Means)

â€¢ Evaluating model performance: Using a suite of standard metrics (confusion matrix, classification report, ROC/AUC, Probability Distribution, Feature importance) to understand how well a model generalizes to unseen data.

â€¢ Comparing different machine learning algorithms: Providing insights into which algorithms might perform better for a given dataset and problem.
